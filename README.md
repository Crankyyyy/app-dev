1. Over the hedge
   - One of the best animated movie I've watched while growing up
2. Diary of a wimpy kid
   - Story about a kid who gets made fun of when he was a kid by his friends and brother, it shows that even though they make fun of you they still love you
3. The boys
   - A show about superheroes. What if superman became evil? This TV show answers that question and makes us understand even those with powers have struggles.
